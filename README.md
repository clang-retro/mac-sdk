# mac-sdk

A redistributable SDK for classic Mac OS applications built with clang
(clang-dos/llvm): System 0.1 to Mac OS 9, on 68k and PowerPC.

## Headers

`include/` has the Toolbox headers. Include them the way Apple's
Universal Interfaces are included (`#include <Quickdraw.h>`,
`<Windows.h>`, `<Events.h>`, ...) or all at once with
`<Multiverse.h>`. The same headers work for both targets:

```sh
clang --target=m68k-apple-macos     -O2 -Iinclude -c hello.c   # 68k
clang --target=powerpc-apple-macos9 -O2 -Iinclude -c hello.c   # PowerPC
```

- On 68k, Toolbox calls are `pascal` functions whose calls become their
  trap words (`__attribute__((raw_inline(...)))`). Register-based traps
  (most OS traps, such as `NewPtr`, `Gestalt` and `Delay`) are inline
  functions that load the registers and emit the trap.
- On PowerPC, the calls are plain declarations that the linker imports
  from InterfaceLib and the other shared libraries.
- Records use 68k alignment on both CPUs, as on a real Mac, so they
  have the sizes Inside Macintosh gives (`tests/sizes.c` checks them).
- 32-bit types are `long`, as in Apple's headers, so existing code that
  passes `long *` compiles unchanged.

`examples/hello.c` uses them; built as a fat application it runs on
every System we have, from System 0.1 on the Mac 128K to Mac OS 9.2.1
on PowerPC, in emulators (MAME, QEMU and SheepShaver).

### Which System has which call

`docs/systems.md` lists, for every call in the headers, the oldest
System that provides it, measured by booting each System we have (29
System and machine pairs, from 0.1 to 9.2.1) and recording its trap
tables, packages and Gestalt selectors (`tools/probe/trapprobe.c`,
`tools/availability.py`, data in `data/availability.tsv`).

- `TrapAvailable(trap)` (OSUtils.h) says at run time whether a trap
  exists, on every ROM from the 64K ROM on. Check it before calling a
  trap newer than the oldest System you support, for example
  `if (TrapAvailable(_Gestalt)) Gestalt(...)`.
- `-DMAC_MIN_SYSTEM=0x0605` makes clang warn at each call that needs a
  newer System than 6.0.5 (or a manager Gestalt must report, such as
  QuickTime). `-DMAC_NO_COLOR_QD` warns at each Color QuickDraw call,
  for the Mac Plus and SE. Without them the headers warn about nothing.
- On the 64K ROM the Memory Manager does not set `MemErr`, so the
  68k calls store D0 there themselves and `MemError()` works on every
  System.

### Mac OS 8

The Mac OS 8 Toolbox is declared too: the Appearance Manager
(`<Appearance.h>`), the Control Manager's embedding, keyboard focus and
control data calls with the Appearance control definitions
(`<Controls.h>`, `<ControlDefinitions.h>`), the Menu, Dialog and Window
Manager additions (menu command IDs, `MenuEvent`, `StandardAlert`,
`AutoSizeDialog`, window collapsing), the Collection Manager
(`<Collections.h>`) and the Contextual Menu Manager
(`<ContextualMenu.h>`).

- What Mac OS 8.0 and 8.1 ran on 68k Macs has its trap and selector,
  read from the 68k glue in 8.1's AppearanceLib and 9.2.1's
  CollectionsLib (`data/trapinfo-os8.json`). The Contextual Menu Manager
  is trap 0xAA72 with selectors 1 to 4, as the Contextual Menu Extension
  installs it.
- Mac OS 8.5 dropped 68k Macs, so its new calls (Appearance Manager 1.1,
  Window Manager 2.0's `CreateNewWindow`, window proxies and properties,
  the 32-bit control values, ...) are declared for PowerPC only. On 68k
  they are left out, so a call to one fails to compile.
- The bevel button, image well, tab and disclosure triangle accessors
  are inline calls to `GetControlData` and `SetControlData` on 68k.

`examples/appearance.c` draws with the theme, builds a hierarchy of
Appearance controls and uses a Collection and menu command IDs. Built
fat, it runs on Mac OS 8.1 on both a 68k Mac (QEMU's `q800`) and a
Power Mac (SheepShaver). Appearance 1.0.1 in 8.1 has no auto-toggling
check boxes or radio buttons (`kControlCheckBoxAutoToggleProc` draws
an ordinary check box), so the example toggles its check box itself.

### Mac OS 9

The calls new in Mac OS 8.5 to 9.2 are declared too: the HFS Plus API
(`FSRef`, Unicode names, forks, catalog iterators and bulk calls),
Icon Services, Folder Manager 9 (folder descriptors and routing), Power
Manager 2, Sound Manager 3.x (sound converters, output info), Display
Manager 2, anti-aliased text, the VM and resource-file additions, the
Thread Manager (`<Threads.h>`), Multiprocessing Services
(`<Multiprocessing.h>`), the Text Encoding and Unicode Converters
(`<TextCommon.h>`, `<TextEncodingConverter.h>`, `<UnicodeConverter.h>`),
URL Access (`<URLAccess.h>`) and the Keychain Manager (`<Keychain.h>`).

- Mac OS 9 still runs 68k applications in its emulator, and the
  PowerPC glue in 9.2.1's InterfaceLib and its other libraries still
  calls a 68k trap for many of these. Those calls have that trap and
  selector on 68k (`data/trapinfo-os9.json`; `tools/retrap.py` attaches
  them to definitions that had none). The high-level HFS Plus calls
  (`FSOpenFork`, `FSGetCatalogInfo`, ...) are inline glue that fills in
  a parameter block and calls the `PB...Sync` trap, as 9.2.1's glue
  does.
- The Thread Manager is trap 0xABF2 on 68k (System 7.5 and later, or
  the Thread Manager extension). Its callbacks are plain function
  pointers on PowerPC too, as in Apple's headers, not routine
  descriptors.
- Multiprocessing Services, the converters, URL Access and the Keychain
  live in PowerPC-only libraries, so they are declared for PowerPC
  only. On 68k a call to one fails to compile.

`examples/macos9.c` runs three cooperative threads, reads the System
Folder's Unicode name with `FSFindFolder` and `FSGetCatalogInfo`, plots
its icon with Icon Services and checks anti-aliased text on both CPUs,
and on PowerPC sums numbers in a preemptive MP task and converts Mac
Roman text to UTF-8 with the Text Encoding Converter. Built fat, it runs
on Mac OS 9.2.1 (QEMU's `mac99`) as PowerPC code, and its 68k build runs
there in the 68k emulator.

### QuickTime

`<Movies.h>`, `<ImageCompression.h>`, `<QuickTimeComponents.h>`,
`<MediaHandler.h>`, `<ImageCodec.h>` and `<MoviesFormat.h>` declare the
QuickTime 1.5 API: the Movie Toolbox, the Image Compression Manager, the
movie controller, sequence grabber, standard compression, video
digitizer, media handler and codec component calls (677 calls), with
QuickTime's own 68k code (`0xAAAA` for the Movie Toolbox, `0xAAA3` for
the Image Compression Manager, `_ComponentDispatch` for components). On
PowerPC they import from QuickTimeLib. Thirteen 1992 names were renamed
or became macros before QuickTimeLib shipped (`SetImageDescriptionExtension`,
`MCGetMovie`, `SCGetCompression`, ...); those link on 68k only.

`examples/quicktime.c` lists the installed compressors, draws 30 frames
in a GWorld, compresses them with the Animation compressor into a new
movie file, opens the file again and plays it in a loop under the
standard movie controller. Its 68k build runs on System 7.1 with
QuickTime 1.5 (QEMU's `q800`), and built fat it runs as PowerPC code on
Mac OS 9.2.1 with QuickTime 5.

### Old routine names

Code written before 1993 uses the original names (`GetCtlValue`,
`DisposPtr`, `GetDItem`, `SetCTitle`, `IUGetIntl`, `TextBox`, ...).
Compile with `-DOLDROUTINENAMES=1` and they map to the current ones, as
with Apple's interfaces; 92 names are covered.

### Where they come from

The headers are generated by `tools/gen-headers.py` from the API
definitions in `defs/`, which come from
[Multiversal Interfaces](https://github.com/autc04/multiversal)
(MIT license, `defs/COPYING.multiversal`). Those were derived from the
clean-room Executor project, not from Apple's headers, so they can be
redistributed freely. To regenerate after changing a definition:

```sh
pip install pyyaml
python3 tools/gen-headers.py
```

Since then the definitions have been extended here with the rest of
the documented Toolbox: the Component, Display, Text Services, Power,
Slot, SCSI, Cursor Device, MIDI, Dictionary and Data Access Managers,
the PPC Toolbox, AppleTalk (MPP, ATP, NBP, ZIP, ASP and AFP), Ethernet,
the Communications Toolbox (Connection, Terminal and File Transfer
Managers, the Communications Resource Manager and the CTB utilities),
the HFS Plus API and more.

The QuickTime definitions (`defs/QuickTime.yaml`, after the first 21
calls) are different: `tools/mpw2defs.py` generated them from Apple's
QuickTime 1.5 C interfaces on the Developer CD Series (1992). It parses
the headers with clang, so the records, constants and each call's
inline 68k code are what Apple's compiler saw, and writes them as
definitions; Apple's headers themselves are not in this repository.
Point the tool at your own copy to regenerate them:

```sh
CLANG=clang python3 tools/mpw2defs.py -I path/to/CIncludes -I path/to/QuickTime \
    -o defs/QuickTime.yaml ImageCompression.h Movies.h MoviesFormat.h \
    QuickTimeComponents.h MediaHandler.h ImageCodec.h
```

### Checked against a real ROM

The 68k trap words and selectors are checked against the Mac OS ROM.
A Power Macintosh ROM contains InterfaceLib, whose PowerPC glue calls
each 68k trap through the Mixed Mode Manager; that glue names the trap,
the selector and where each argument goes.

- `tools/trapinfo.py ROM > data/trapinfo.json` reads that glue (from a
  4 MB OldWorld ROM image, such as the Beige G3's) and records each
  call. The checked-in `data/trapinfo.json` came from the Beige G3 ROM.
- `tools/check-traps.py` compares every call in the headers with it.
  All 1,960 calls that the ROM and the Mac OS 8 and 9 libraries describe
  match.
- `tools/add-protos.py defs/X.yaml < protos.h` turns C prototypes into
  definitions, with the 68k details from `data/trapinfo.json`, and
  refuses a prototype whose argument sizes disagree with the ROM.
  `tools/add-types.py` does the same for records and constants.
- `tools/blockinfo.py ROM > data/blockinfo.json` does the same for the
  Communications Toolbox calls, which pass their arguments as a block
  (laid out like Pascal arguments under a selector word, with A0
  pointing at it) to `_CommToolboxDispatch`. It records the selector
  and each argument's offset and size; `tests/blocks.py` checks all 166
  such calls in the headers against it. It needs `llvm-mc` with the
  PowerPC target.
- `tools/check-mpw.py path/to/CIncludes [more dirs]` compares the 68k
  code of every call with the inline code in Apple's MPW C interfaces
  (the trap word, and the selector loaded before it, however it is
  loaded). Against MPW 3.2's interfaces (June 1992) and QuickTime 1.5's,
  all 2,105 calls both declare match; the 18 MPW calls it reports
  missing have C or glue equivalents here (the low-memory accessors,
  `Fix2X` and friends).
- `tools/coverage.py` writes [docs/coverage.md](docs/coverage.md).

Calls with no trap of their own get their 68k glue as inline C in the
headers (`m68k-body` in the definitions; `tools/set-body.py` adds it).
The AppleTalk calls set the driver and control code and call PBControl,
as the ROM's PowerPC glue does; the high-level File Manager, Device
Manager and serial calls fill in a parameter block; the lowercase
C-string calls (`fsopen`, `getwtitle`, ...) convert their strings and
call the Pascal routine. The glue avoids `memcpy`, `memset` and 32-bit
multiplies, since there is no 68k runtime library yet (BlockMoveData
copies instead). `include/needs-glue.txt` lists what is left: mostly
calls that never ran on 68k (Navigation Services, Driver Services, the
Name Registry).

## Building applications

`tools/macapp.py` compiles C sources with this SDK's headers and links
them into an application, fat (68k and PowerPC) by default:

```sh
CLANG=path/to/clang python3 tools/macapp.py -o Hello.bin examples/hello.c
python3 tools/macapp.py --cpu 68k -o Hello68.bin examples/hello.c -- -DDEBUG
hmount disk.img && hcopy -m Hello.bin :Hello && humount
```

Flags after `--` go to clang. The output is MacBinary II, for
hfsutils' `hcopy -m`. `--name`, `--creator` and `--size` (the memory
partition in KB) set the Finder name, the creator code and the `SIZE`
resource; `--carbon` imports from CarbonLib first on PowerPC.

The linkers it runs are in `tools/link/` and can be used on their own:

- `codelink.py` links the ELF objects that clang's `m68k-apple-macos`
  target makes, with `start.s` first, into one CODE 1 resource linked
  at address 0, followed by a table of the absolute pointers in it.
  CODE 0 is a one-entry jump table. At launch `start.s` adds the load
  address to each pointer, calls `_FlushCodeCache` where the trap exists
  (not on the 64K ROM, nor on System 6 on a Mac Plus or SE) and calls
  `main`. Code reaches data PC-relative, so a 68k program must stay
  within 32 KB until the compiler gets a large code model.
- `peflink.py` links the XCOFF objects that `powerpc-apple-macos9`
  makes into a PEF application (a `cfrg` 0 resource, the PEF container
  in the data fork). Each imported call gets a glue stub that restores
  the TOC. It finds which shared library exports each name in
  `imports.json` (from Retro68's import libraries, by `gen-imports.py`;
  `macos-exports.py` makes one from a real System Folder and ROM).
  InterfaceLib wins a name that other libraries also export; CarbonLib
  and `Apple;Carbon;Networking` are imported weakly.
- `fatlink.py` merges the two: the PowerPC code in the data fork, named
  by `cfrg`, and the 68k code in CODE. A Power Mac runs the PowerPC
  code and a 68k Mac runs CODE.

Not done yet in the linkers: archives (`.a`), static constructors,
shared libraries (exports), and pattern-compressed PEF data.

### Testing

- `tools/sim68k.py App.bin` runs a 68k application on a 68k CPU
  emulator (the `unicorn` Python package) and prints each Toolbox trap
  it makes, with its arguments. Only a few traps are faked, so it checks
  code generation, relocation and stack balance for small programs, not
  drawing.
- `tools/mame/` boots Apple's System disks in MAME (Systems 0.1 to 7.1)
  with an application in place of the Finder: `mkroms.py` makes ROM sets
  from dumps you own, `matrix.py App.bin OUTDIR` boots every System and
  screenshots each one, `harddisk.sh` boots System 7 from a hard disk
  image, `mfs.py` reads and writes the MFS 400K disks of Systems 0.1 to
  2.0, `dc42.py` converts DiskCopy 4.2 images, and `crashdump.lua`
  writes the registers when an application crashes.
- `tools/qemu/boot-q800.sh` boots System 7.6.1 or Mac OS 8.1 on QEMU's
  `q800` from a copy of the install CD with the application on it (you
  supply a Quadra 800 ROM image). `tools/qemu/boot.sh` boots Mac OS 9 on
  QEMU's `mac99` with a transfer disk, and `tools/qemu/mon.py` takes
  screenshots and clicks through the QEMU monitor.
- For PowerPC on Mac OS 8.1 and earlier, use SheepShaver with an
  OldWorld ROM image (such as the beige G3's), with the install CD
  attached as a CD-ROM.

## Tests

```sh
CLANG=path/to/clang tests/run.sh
```

It compiles every header for both targets in C and C++, generates code
for every 68k inline function, checks the size of every record whose
definition gives one, checks the argument-block calls against the ROM,
and links every example into a fat application.

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs it for every pull request and push,
with the newest clang from clang-retro/llvm's `llvm-prebuilt` release,
and also fails when `include/` or `docs/coverage.md` differ from what
`tools/gen-headers.py` and `tools/coverage.py` write.

## Not done yet

- Coverage: the headers declare all but 3 undocumented symbols of what
  the ROM's InterfaceLib exports (see docs/coverage.md).
- 68k glue for the rest of `needs-glue.txt` that did run on 68k (the
  Fixed/extended conversions, the 64-bit Wide math, TESetWordBreak and TESetClickLoop, which need a register
  trampoline), and a runtime library (`__udivsi3`, `memcpy` and the
  other helpers clang calls on 68k).
- Archives, static constructors and shared libraries in the linkers,
  and a large code model for 68k programs over 32 KB.
